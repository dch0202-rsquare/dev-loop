# infrastructure — Domain Index

Route here for: CI/CD pipeline design, secrets in build/deploy flows, container
image builds, container resource limits and health probes, per-environment
configuration (env vars, config drift, startup validation), rollout/rollback
strategy, observability (logging, metrics, alerting), datastore backup/restore
and data-loss planning.

Match your situation to a "load when" line; load only matching pages.

## ci-cd

| Page | Load when |
|------|-----------|
| [pipeline-structure](ci-cd/pipeline-structure.md) | Creating or restructuring a CI pipeline; CI is slow, unreliable, or reports failures too late; deciding where a new check/stage belongs |
| [secrets-handling](ci-cd/secrets-handling.md) | A build or deploy step needs credentials (registry, cloud, private packages, signing); reviewing how secrets flow through CI; a secret leaked (log/chat/commit) and deciding the response |

## config

| Page | Load when |
|------|-----------|
| [environment-config](config/environment-config.md) | Adding configuration that differs per environment; a bug traced to a dev/stg/prd config difference; config sprawled across hardcoded values, files, and env vars; reviewing how a service gets its settings |

## containers

| Page | Load when |
|------|-----------|
| [image-builds](containers/image-builds.md) | Writing or reviewing a Dockerfile; images rebuild everything on small changes, build slowly, or are too large; choosing an image tagging scheme |
| [resource-limits-and-probes](containers/resource-limits-and-probes.md) | Writing or reviewing Kubernetes-style deployment manifests; pods OOMKilled, evicted, or CPU-throttled; a dependency outage triggered a restart storm; traffic hitting pods that are not ready |
| [pid1-log-flushing](containers/pid1-log-flushing.md) | A container's PID1 bash script tees stdout to a file (`exec > >(tee -a …)`) and log lines go missing (short jobs empty, long jobs lose the tail); handling SIGTERM/exit so a container's logs flush before teardown |

## data

| Page | Load when |
|------|-----------|
| [backup-and-restore](data/backup-and-restore.md) | Setting up backups for a datastore; auditing existing backups; planning for data-loss scenarios (deletion, corruption, bad migration, ransomware/account compromise, region loss) |

## deploy

| Page | Load when |
|------|-----------|
| [rollout-and-rollback](deploy/rollout-and-rollback.md) | Designing how a service reaches production (rollout strategy, health gating); preparing a risky release; a deploy involves a schema change, data migration, or feature flag and you need rollback mechanics |

## observability

| Page | Load when |
|------|-----------|
| [logs-metrics-signals](observability/logs-metrics-signals.md) | Instrumenting a new or existing service (logs, metrics, correlation ids); an incident revealed you couldn't see what happened; choosing between a log line and a metric; a metric label would carry unbounded values (user ids/UUIDs) |
| [alerting](observability/alerting.md) | Creating or reviewing alerts; the team ignores a noisy pager; deciding whether a condition pages, tickets, or stays on a dashboard |
| [kubelet-container-metrics-missing](observability/kubelet-container-metrics-missing.md) | kube-prometheus-stack kubelet targets are UP but `container_cpu_*`/`container_memory_*` series are empty and pod CPU/memory dashboards are blank; a non-standard kubelet (OrbStack, Docker Desktop, minimal k3s) emits only `machine_*` from cAdvisor; deciding to scrape `/metrics/resource`; distinguishing "target up" from "series present" |
