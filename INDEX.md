# Root Index — Domain Map

Route by matching your current task to a "route here when" line, then open that
domain's `index.md`. Load nothing else at this level.

`scaffold` domains have **no pages yet** — do not route into them expecting answers;
follow the cross-pointers in their index or take the next matching seeded domain
(routing protocol step 1, `AGENTS.md`).

| Domain | Status | Route here when |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| [databases](wiki/databases/index.md) | **seeded** | Designing schemas/tables/keys, choosing or evaluating indexes, writing or optimizing queries, choosing transaction/isolation behavior |
| [backend](wiki/backend/index.md) | **seeded** | Server-side application code — language-agnostic (`common/`: API contracts, idempotency, JWT, timeouts/retries, caching, jobs, transactions in app code, shared state/pools, errors) plus stack subtrees: `java/` (JPA, Spring proxies, JVM threads/memory), `node/` (event loop, promises, runtime validation, shutdown), `python/` (GIL/asyncio, pydantic, WSGI/ASGI workers, language traps) |
| [frontend](wiki/frontend/index.md) | **seeded** | Web UI code: state placement, rendering performance, in-UI data fetching (races, infinite scroll), auth token handling, forms, XSS-safe output, accessibility |
| [infrastructure](wiki/infrastructure/index.md) | **seeded** | CI/CD pipelines, secrets in build/deploy, container image builds, rollout/rollback strategy, observability (logs/metrics/alerting) |
| [testing](wiki/testing/index.md) | **seeded** | Writing or structuring automated tests: level choice, cases/assertions, test data, mock decisions, flaky tests (release-process quality → qa) |
| [qa](wiki/qa/index.md) | **seeded** | Release-quality process: release gates, regression scoping, bug reports, severity/priority triage, exploratory testing (writing automated test code → testing) |
| [debugging](wiki/debugging/index.md) | **seeded** | Diagnosing a failure — finding what is wrong and why: reproducing, bisection, hypothesis testing, traces/logs, intermittent failures (fixing the diagnosed fault → its owning domain) |
| [security](wiki/security/index.md) | **seeded** | Trust-boundary decisions: input validation, session-vs-token auth choice, per-resource authorization (IDOR), secrets hygiene, dependency trust, PII handling (XSS rendering → frontend; CI secrets → infrastructure; JWT implementation → backend/frontend auth) |
| [platforms](wiki/platforms/index.md) | **seeded** | OS-level differences breaking code across macOS/Linux/Windows: shell portability, BSD-vs-GNU CLI, filesystem case/line endings, background services/cron, environment inputs that redirect a tool (PATH, endpoint/base-URL overrides), toolchain version pinning |
| [mobile](wiki/mobile/index.md) | **seeded** | App-side iOS/Android/cross-platform: process death/state survival, offline-first sync, mobile-network calls, store rollout/hotfix strategy, startup time |

All ten domains are seeded. New categories grow via `skills/wiki-ingest/SKILL.md`.
